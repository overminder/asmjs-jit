### As a jit library

- Should be easier to use than directly targeting asm.js
- This includes: strong typing, type inference and explicit casting
- Automatic local and global variable management
- Automatic pointer management
- Automatic function pointer management
- Support for tail recursion (to loop) and tail call elim (by trampol)?
